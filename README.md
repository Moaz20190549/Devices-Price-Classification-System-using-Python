# Devices-Price-Classification-System-using-Python
The first part of the code trains a RandomForest model to classify device prices based on their specifications.
The second part sets up a Flask API that uses this trained model to predict the price range of a device based on JSON input from the client. The predictions are made by scaling the input features and passing them to the pre-trained model.
